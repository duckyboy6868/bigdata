 	Transparent Huge Page Compaction is enabled and can cause significant performance problems. Run "echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag" and "echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled" to disable this, and then add the same command to an init script such as /etc/rc.local so it will be set on system reboot. 

echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag
echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled


echo "vm.swappiness=0" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
sysctl -p
